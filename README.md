# Raspberry Pi Projects

This repo is a collection of projects that I have used for my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.


## My Setup

I have a [raspberry pi 3 Model B](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Clear-Power-Supply/dp/B01C6EQNNK/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1476103434&sr=1-4&keywords=raspberry+pi+3) in an [EEEKIT case](https://www.amazon.com/Enclosure-External-Raspberry-Accessory-EEEKit/dp/B01EIZ7WIK/ref=sr_1_43?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1476103483&sr=1-43&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+fan+case) with a [Samsung 16GB SD Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVPU7KE/ref=pd_bxgy_147_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=BPMHCNVS76DR1BPGRC6X&th=1). I also use my [GPIO kit by viaboot](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Breakout-Breadboard-Projects-Components/dp/B017C54VZA/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1476103581&sr=1-1&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+gpio).


## Contributing

Since this repo is just full of projects that I have worked on in my spare time, I probably wont merge any Pull Requests unless they are major bug fixes. If you think the project should work in a different way, feel free to clone or fork my repo and customize it the way you like it.
