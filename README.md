# My Pi Projects

This repo is just a collection of projects that I have played around with using my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.


## Contributing

Since this repo is just full of projects that I have worked on in my spare time, I probably wont merge any Pull Requests unless they are major bug fixes. If you think the project should work in a different way, feel free to clone or fork my repo and customize it the way you like it.
